# Divine Proportions Toolkit

This toolkit eases the process of composing your work (be it a photograph or a design) with a list of features and functionalities that create shapes mocking the divine proportions.

Using the kit is really simple: just select a layer, make a marquee selection and choose the path type you need.

You can then scale, rotate or edit the path.

## How to Compile

This extension is developed using [Adobe Configurator 3](http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/configurator.html) (just open the _.gpc_ file).

## Reference and Documentation

Documentation on how to use the toolkit can be found [on my website](http://thebitcave.com/2012/12/09/divine-proportions-toolkit-documentation/).
